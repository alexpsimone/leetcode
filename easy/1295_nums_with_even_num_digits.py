# can stringify the int and find the length of the string

# can divide by 10, 1000, 100000 and check mod/remainder;
    # if mod is less than the divisor then it has the same # digits as the divisor

# is list ordered?
    # if so, and first/last digits have same num digits, then we know how many digits the rest have
